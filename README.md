The threat of malware variants continuously increases. Several approaches have 
been applied to malware clustering for a better understanding on how to characterize 
families. Among them, behavioral analysis is one that can use supervised or unsupervised 
learning methods. This type of analysis is mainly based on conventional (crisp) logic, 
in which a particular sample must belong only to one malware family. In this work, 
we propose a behavioral clustering approach using fuzzy logic, which assigns a relevance 
degree to each sample and consequently enables it to be part of more than one family. This
approach enables to check other behaviors of the samples, not visualized in conventional logic. 
We compare the chosen fuzzy logic algorithm — Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) — with K-Means so as to 
analyze their similarities and show the advantages of FCM for malware behavioral analysis.
